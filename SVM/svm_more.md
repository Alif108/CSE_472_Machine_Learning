Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are primarily used for classification tasks, but they can also be applied to regression problems. Let's explore both use cases:

# Classification:
## Binary Classification:
SVMs are widely used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to assign data points to one of two classes.

## Multiclass Classification:
SVMs can be extended to handle multiclass classification through methods like one-vs-one or one-vs-all. In one-vs-one, a binary classifier is trained for each pair of classes, and in one-vs-all, a separate binary classifier is trained for each class against the rest.

## Non-linear Decision Boundaries:
SVMs are effective when dealing with non-linear decision boundaries, especially when using the kernel trick to map data into a higher-dimensional space.

## Image Classification:
SVMs have been successfully applied to image classification tasks, such as handwritten digit recognition.


# Regression:
## Support Vector Regression (SVR):

SVMs can be used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous variable. This variant is called Support Vector Regression (SVR).

## Non-linear Regression:
SVR is particularly useful when dealing with non-linear relationships between input features and the target variable.

## Robust to Outliers:
SVMs, including SVR, are robust to outliers in the data, as the model focuses on the support vectors that are crucial for defining the decision boundary or regression hyperplane.

# Use Cases:

## Text and Hypertext Categorization:
SVMs have been used for text classification tasks, such as spam detection and sentiment analysis.

## Image Recognition:
In computer vision, SVMs have been employed for tasks like image classification and object detection.

## Bioinformatics:
SVMs have found applications in bioinformatics, such as predicting protein-protein interactions.

## Financial Forecasting:
SVMs can be used for financial forecasting tasks, such as predicting stock prices.

## Decision Boundaries:
SVMs are known for finding the hyperplane that maximally separates classes in feature space. In classification, the decision boundary is the hyperplane that distinguishes between classes.

In regression, the goal is to find a hyperplane that captures the trend in the data, minimizing deviations from the actual target values.

# Summary:
- Classification: SVMs are widely used for classification tasks, especially when dealing with non-linear decision boundaries.

- Regression: SVMs can be applied to regression tasks, particularly when there are non-linear relationships or the data contains outliers.

- Versatility: SVMs are versatile and have been successfully applied to various domains, including computer vision, bioinformatics, finance, and text analysis.
